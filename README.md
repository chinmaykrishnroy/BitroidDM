# BitroidDM
*Development Stage* A BitTorrent client for searching and downloading torrent files in python.
### Development of BitroidDM is currently paused due to compatibility issues with Python 3.11+ bindings. While you can search torrents and use the magnet link to download via other torrent clients, the internal download and other features are still being developed. I apologize for the delay and expect to resolve this within the next few months. Thank you for your patience.
